# Quickstart

## Quickstart

Recover stranded liquidity in four simple steps.

PoolRescue automatically scans your connected wallet for LP tokens, gauges, and unclaimed rewards across supported chains and protocols.

***

#### 🪙 1. Select a Chain

Choose your preferred network from the dropdown — e.g. **Scroll**, **Mantle**, **Arbitrum**, or **Ethereum**.\
Each chain is scanned using its native RPC endpoint for optimal accuracy.

> 💡 **Tip:** Make sure your wallet is already connected to the same chain you’re scanning.

***

#### 💧 2. Choose a Protocol

Pick the DEX or AMM you previously used, such as:

* **Skydrome** (Scroll)
* **Tokan** (Scroll)
* **Stratum** (Mantle)
* **Fraxswap** (Ethereum)

PoolRescue automatically loads the correct pool and gauge data.

***

#### 🔍 3. Scan Positions

Click **Scan** — PoolRescue checks your wallet for:

* LP tokens
* Gauge deposits
* Pending rewards

The results table shows: \
`Protocol | Pair | Token | Token | LP in Wallet or Gauge | Liquidity | Rewards`

***

#### 🎁 4. Claim or Withdraw

Once your LPs and rewards are detected:

* **Withdraw from Gauge:** Unstake your LP tokens if still deposited.
* **Remove Liquidity:** Fully exit the pool and recover base assets.
* **Claim Rewards:** Collect earned tokens from gauges or bribe contracts.

***

#### 💸 Infrastructure Fee

To cover RPC, hosting, and infrastructure costs, PoolRescue applies a **2.5% fee on recovered tokens** during the alpha phase.\
If ecosystem grants or sponsorships are obtained, this fee may be **reduced or redistributed** among contributors.

> Transparency first — all fee logic is open source and visible in the PoolRescue smart contracts.

***

#### ⚠️ Notes

* Ensure you have native gas tokens (ETH, MNT, etc.) before executing transactions.
* Reward tokens vary by protocol (e.g., `SKY`, `STRAT`, `CC`).
