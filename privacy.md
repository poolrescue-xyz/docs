# Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** October 28, 2025

PoolRescue is a non-custodial, client-side web application. We do not run a login system, we do not take custody of assets, and we do not sell or rent personal data.

This Privacy Policy explains what information is (and isn’t) collected when you use PoolRescue.

***

### 1) What We Collect

* **No account data.** We do not collect names, emails, or passwords.
* **No behavioral tracking.** We do not run analytics, pixels, or ad trackers.
* **No cookies for profiling.** We do not set cookies for advertising or user profiling.

> PoolRescue processes information **locally in your browser**. Wallet interactions are initiated by you and sent directly to blockchain nodes (RPC endpoints).

***

### 2) Wallet & On-Chain Data

* When you connect a wallet, your **public address** and **balances/allowances** may be read **client-side** to detect LP positions and gauges.
* Transactions you sign are broadcast to the **public blockchain** and become public records.
* PoolRescue **does not store** your private keys. Signing always occurs in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby).

***

### 3) Network & Hosting Logs

Our hosting provider may automatically log standard HTTP request metadata (e.g., IP address, user-agent, timestamp, requested path) for short periods to operate and secure the service. We do not combine these logs with any other data to identify you.

***

### 4) Third-Party Services

PoolRescue interacts with third parties to function:

* **RPC Providers / Node Operators** (to read chain data and broadcast transactions)
* **Block Explorers** (e.g., Etherscan family, chain explorers) for verified contract sources
* **CDNs / Hosting** (to deliver static assets)

These providers may log requests under their own policies. Review their privacy policies for details.

***

### 5) Cookies

* PoolRescue does **not** set tracking or advertising cookies.
* Essential, short-lived cookies may be used by your wallet extension or our hosting/CDN to deliver the site securely.

***

### 6) Data Retention

* PoolRescue does not maintain user databases.
* Hosting/security logs (if any) are retained only as long as necessary for operations and legal compliance.

***

### 7) Your Rights

Depending on your location (e.g., GDPR/EEA or CCPA/California), you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data held by controllers. Because PoolRescue does not keep user profiles or store wallet data, there is typically **no on-file data** to access or delete. For logs or RPC data, contact the relevant provider.

***

### 8) Children’s Privacy

PoolRescue is not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). Do not use PoolRescue if you are under the applicable age.

***

### 9) Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in technology, law, or our practices. Material changes will be reflected by updating the **“Last updated”** date above.
